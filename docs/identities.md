## Identity Interfaces in OneImlx

The `OneImlx` identity framework provides a set of interfaces that define various types of entities within the system. These interfaces serve as blueprints for representing and interacting with different types of entities, ensuring consistency and extensibility.

- **IPersonIdentity**: Represents individuals or users within the OneImlx ecosystem. It includes user-specific attributes such as email.

- **IServiceIdentity**: Represents service entities and their associated properties. Service identities allow for the representation of various services within the system.

- **IProductIdentity**: Represents product entities with their unique characteristics.

- **IDeviceIdentity**: Represents device or hardware entities, accommodating device-specific attributes.

- **IEquipmentIdentity**: Represents large equipment or machinery entities within the system.

- **IDomainIdentity**: Represents domains or engineering disciplines, allowing for specialization.

- **IProcessIdentity**: Represents manufacturing or operations processes, allowing for process-specific attributes.

- **IOperationIdentity**: Represents specialized operations within the OneImlx framework, with a focus on operation type.

- **IDepartmentIdentity**: Represents departments or organizational units within entities.

- **IFacilityIdentity**: Represents facilities or physical locations within the OneImlx ecosystem.

- **IFactoryIdentity**: Represents factory entities and includes properties such as factory location.

- **IOrganizationIdentity**: Represents organizations, businesses, governments, or legal entities, serving as the overall owner.

These identity interfaces ensure a consistent approach to identity across the `OneImlx` framework, making it easier to work with a wide range of entities while maintaining clarity and structure.
