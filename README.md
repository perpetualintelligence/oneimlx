The `OneImlx` Framework is a comprehensive and versatile solution designed to address various needs across multiple industries. It provides a robust infrastructure for developing and managing drivers, hardware interactions, job management, access management, licensing, networking, and more. The framework is modular, allowing for the integration of different components as needed.

## OneImlx.Abstractions

The `OneImlx.Abstractions` module contains common, shared code that serves as the foundation for the entire OneImlx Framework. This module includes essential abstractions, interfaces, and utility classes that are used across different parts of the framework.

### Key Features
- **Common Interfaces**: Shared interfaces that standardize the behavior of various components.
- **Utility Classes**: Helper classes that provide common functionality used throughout the framework.

## OneImlx.Iam

The `OneImlx.Iam` module is a cross-platform multi-tenant access management framework that is agnostic to any specific identity solution. It provides a robust and flexible system for managing access across different tenants and platforms.

### Key Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports multiple platforms for broad applicability.
- **Multi-Tenant**: Designed to manage access across multiple tenants.
- **Identity Solution Agnostic**: Can be integrated with various identity solutions without being tied to any specific one.
- **Access Management**: Comprehensive tools for managing access control and permissions.

## OneImlx.Drivers

The `OneImlx.Drivers` module provides a robust infrastructure for developing and managing drivers for hardware, IoT devices, and semiconductors. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, making it suitable for various other industries as well.

### Key Features
- **Driver Management**: Interfaces and classes for managing the lifecycle of drivers.
- **Hardware Interaction**: Abstractions for interacting with hardware components.
- **IoT and Semiconductor Support**: Specialized support for IoT devices and semiconductor components.
- **Extensibility**: Can be extended to support additional industries and use cases.
- **UX Rendering**: Includes `IRenderer` and `IDriverRenderer` interfaces to support rendering UX for drivers. `IRenderer` generates a metadata file (e.g., JSON) containing information regarding UX components, layout, dashboarding, charting, etc. A different service reads this metadata to render the UI, ensuring the core driver is independent of the actual UX. Drivers may also support attributes that aid in rendering.

## OneImlx.Jobs

The `OneImlx.Jobs` module is focused on high-performance job management. It provides the necessary interfaces and structures to manage and execute jobs and workloads efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Job Management**: Interfaces for defining and managing jobs.
- **Workload Management**: Structures for grouping and managing multiple jobs as workloads.
- **Scheduling**: Support for scheduling workloads for execution.
- **Diagnostics**: Tools for monitoring and diagnosing job and workload execution.

## OneImlx.Licensing

The `OneImlx.Licensing` module is a cross-platform claim-based modern licensing framework. It provides a flexible and secure system for managing software licenses using claim-based access control.

### Key Features
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports multiple platforms for broad applicability.
- **Claim-Based**: Utilizes claim-based access control for modern and flexible licensing.
- **Secure Licensing**: Ensures secure management of software licenses.
- **Extensible**: Can be extended to fit various licensing models and requirements.

## OneImlx.Network

The `OneImlx.Network` module provides a network-agnostic session management framework for applications and services that are agnostic to network protocols. It enables efficient and flexible session management across various network environments.

### Key Features
