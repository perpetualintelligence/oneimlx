# OneImlx

## Introduction
`OneImlx` is a unified claims-based framework that seamlessly integrates Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Licensing. At its core, it operates based on two main guiding principles: understanding **what** actions or operations a user or entity can perform (i.e., "can-do") and determining **what** they are licensed for (i.e., "has-license-for").

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Authorization
- **`who` -> `can-do` -> `what`**: This principle ensures that after identifying a user or entity, `OneImlx` accurately determines the specific actions or operations they are authorized to perform.

### 2. Licensing
- **`who` -> `has-license-for` -> `what`**: Here, This principle checks and confirms the licenses associated with a user or entity, making sure they access or use only what they are licensed for.

## Terminology
- **who**: Refers to the user or entity being evaluated. In a claims-based context, it represents the claim subject.
  
- **can-do**: Indicates the permissible actions or operations that the identified user or entity is authorized to perform. This stems from the claims assigned to the "who".

- **has-license-for**: Addresses the entitlements or licenses associated with a user or entity, ascertaining the resources or products they are permitted to access or utilize.

- **what**: Represents the end resource, service, or product that the "who" is either licensed to access or authorized to interact with.

## Cross-Platform 
`OneImlx` is designed to be inherently cross-platform, meaning it's built to function consistently across multiple platforms, be it Windows, Linux, macOS, or others. This capability ensures flexibility and broad applicability, irrespective of the platform preference of the end-users or the organization.

## Deployment Agnostic
The framework boasts a deployment-agnostic nature, allowing organizations to deploy it in diverse environments. Whether you want to use `OneImlx` on-premises, in a hybrid setting, or fully in the cloud, the functionality remains consistent. This agnostic approach ensures scalability and adaptability to fit various infrastructure models and future-proofing the system against ever-evolving IT landscapes.
